    <p>Juneteenth (officially Juneteenth National Independence Day) is a federal holiday in the United States
        commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. Deriving its name from combining June and
        nineteenth, it is celebrated on the anniversary of the order by Major General Gordon Granger proclaiming freedom
        for enslaved people in Texas on June 19, 1865 (two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was
        issued).[7] Originating in Galveston, Juneteenth has since been observed annually in various parts of the United
        States, often broadly celebrating African-American culture. The day was recognized as a federal holiday in 2021,
        when President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law.

        <p>Early celebrations date back to 1866, at first involving church-centered community gatherings in Texas. They
            spread across the South and became more commercialized in the 1920s and 1930s, often centering on a food
            festival. Participants in the Great Migration brought these celebrations to the rest of the country. During
            the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, these celebrations were eclipsed by the nonviolent determination to
            achieve civil rights, but grew in popularity again in the 1970s with a focus on African American freedom and
            African-American arts. Beginning with Texas by proclamation in 1938, and by legislation in 1979, every U.S.
            state and the District of Columbia has formally recognized the holiday in some way. Juneteenth is also
            celebrated by the Mascogos, descendants of Black Seminoles who escaped from slavery in 1852 and settled in
            Coahuila, Mexico.

    <h2>Celebrations and traditions</h2>
    <p>The holiday is considered the "longest-running African-American holiday"[9] and has been called "America's second
        Independence Day"[by whom?]. Juneteenth is usually celebrated on the third Saturday in June. Historian Mitch
        Kachun considers that celebrations of the end of slavery have three goals: "to celebrate, to educate, and to
        agitate".[10] Early celebrations consisted of baseball, fishing, and rodeos. African Americans were often
        prohibited from using public facilities for their celebrations, so they were often held at churches or near
        water. Celebrations were also characterized by elaborate large meals and people wearing their best clothing.[9]
        It was common for formerly enslaved people and their descendants to make a pilgrimage to Galveston.[11] As early
        festivals received news coverage, Janice Hume and Noah Arceneaux consider that they "served to assimilate
        African-American memories within the dominant 'American story'".[12]</p>
    <div>
        <p>Observance today is primarily in local celebrations.[13] In many places, Juneteenth has become a
            multicultural holiday.[14] Traditions include public readings of the Emancipation Proclamation which
            promised freedom, singing traditional songs such as "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" and "Lift Every Voice and
            Sing", and reading of works by noted African-American writers, such as Ralph Ellison and Maya Angelou.[13]
            Celebrations include picnics, rodeos, street fairs, cookouts, family reunions, park parties, historical
            reenactments, blues festivals, and Miss Juneteenth contests.[9][11][15][16][17] Red food and drinks are
            traditional during the celebrations, including red velvet cake and strawberry soda, with red meant to
            represent resilience and joy.[16][11][18]

            Juneteenth celebrations often include lectures and exhibitions on African-American culture.[10] The modern
            holiday places much emphasis on teaching about African-American heritage. Karen M. Thomas wrote in Emerge
            that "community leaders have latched on to [Juneteenth] to help instill a sense of heritage and pride in
            black youth". Celebrations are commonly accompanied by voter registration efforts, the performing of plays,
            and retelling stories.[19] The holiday is also a celebration of soul food and other food with
            African-American influences. In Tourism Review International, Anne Donovan and Karen DeBres write that
            "Barbecue is the centerpiece of most Juneteenth celebrations".[20] Major news networks now host specials and
            marathons on national outlets featuring prominent Black voic    es.[21]

            Many other countries celebrate Emancipation Day on August 1, and a few on other dates. The people of
            Nacimiento in Mexico hold a festival and reunion, known as el DÃ­a de los Negros on June 19. [22][23] [24]
            Since 2021, the United Nations has designated August 31 as the International Day for People of African
            Descent.[citation needed]</p>
